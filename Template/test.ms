I started this work to establish a better framework with which my brother could
invest in his agricultural business. The intention was always to show the
mathematics behind the formulas and not to simply present them for use. Is
there too much mathematics? There maybe, but it is difficult to understand the
concepts without the maths. The problem of including a lot of maths is that
your have to presume a certain level of knowledge or you are resigned to
writing a maths primer before you start. I have tried to show the steps through
the equations so that it is hopefully possible to follow the logic even if your
understanding of the maths is a little rusty.
.LP
Moving past the maths the work looks to cover the concept of the Time Value of
Money and move through the most common types of annuity. The understanding of
Time Value of Money, equivalence, annuities and perpetuities are the building
blocks for much of finance and important for both business and personal
investment decisions.
.LP
Once we have grasped the mathematics behind the finance we cover the problems
of establishing the discount rate to use and subsequently how to decide how to
choose whether an investment is going to increase your wealth. It is always
worth remembering that there is a limitless supply of negative return
opportunities.
.LP
Tax is always a bind but can not often be ignored as it is not often avoided.
The tax section is quite large but by the end you should feel more confident
with both the impact of the tax and how to account for it.
.LP
Lastly there is always a choice of whether a investment should be made or a
piece of equipment replaced. These are the fundamental questions in most
businesses and this work aims to place at your disposal some principles that
should make you more confident when making that decision.
.LP
The latter part of the document looks at how to measure the performance of your
business once an investment has been made. The idea being to show that the
measurement of financial performance can be in someway tied back to the process
used to make the investment.
.LP
The last part of the document concerns break even analysis or cost volume
analysis as it is sometimes known. It could be argued that this either belongs
at the beginning of the document or not in the document at all. This is a fair
point. I wanted to include the information but wanted to focus on the time
value of money and not be distracted by break even analysis, which is not a
means of allocating capital. Break even analysis has its place in monitoring
ongoing performance and also looking at the possibility that an investment
could add value to a business.
